The problem:
It can be difficult to find someone who can move or deliver items between locations at an affordable rate. Often people do not have access to vehicles such as a small truck or ute which means they have to rely on movers, at their rates or rent a vehicle. These solutions can be expensive due to time constraints, charging more if services are needed immediately or can be potentially costly if something happens to the rented vehicle.

The solution:
The app solves this problem of costly/time constraints in regards to moving since it puts clients, those who need of something moved in contact with drivers who have a vehicle and would have happy to provide those services at a cost. With similar style apps emerging like Uber, it would be useful for movers to follow suit. This app aims to provide a more time manageable solution arranged between clients and drivers while providing a more cost effective solution to both groups. An ethical consideration for the app would be what course of action is taken if a particular item (eg a washing machine) breaks while being delivered and who would be at fault over this.


The app is a two sided marketplace where drivers can contact clients or post their services on the app, set a price and the range of the service while clients can contact drivers or post their required service and the rate at how much they are willing to pay.

Design Decisions:
The design decisions used were mostly through Bootstrap and CSS. The decision for using these style of designs was due to their ease of access, time constraints and how effective they are. The fonts and colours were kept relatively simple to demonstrate to users the ease of understanding and following around the website with minimal difficulty.

Future Development / Project Improvements:
Future plans for the app will include:
1)	The addition of an internal messaging system.
2)	A user rating system, based on 5 stars.
3)	Additional user information.
4)	A custom payment option.
